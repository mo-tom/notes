1972 Food price shock

# Factors

## Russia's "Great Grain Robbery"
Following own product shortfalls, Russia bought near to 25% percent of the whole US's yearly grain produce in 1971.

### Shortfall of global crop production in 1971
Several gobal regions experienced droughts which caused production to fall.

### Missing ability to spot Russia's production shortfall
The sale happened just a few months before the first satellite (LandSat 1) capable of detecting crop quality. So there was no awarness of the real production shortfalls endures by Russia due to drought.

### Governance inabilities to assess amount of Russian buy
Led to introduction of Export Sales Reporting Program to be able to react to sudden demand rise in order to not deplete stocks and keep prices in check.

### Peruvian anchovy crisis
El Nino reduced flows of nutrition for anchovy fish which massively reduced its population.


# Further questions

## Suez closure 1967-75
What factor played the closure of the Suez canal between 1967 (Six Days War) until 1975? Thinking: longer trade routes (to deliver oil to developed countries from the Gulf) put pressure on oil prices which in turn (as a input factor) fed into the price of agricultural produce. Cp. <https://voxeu.org/article/1967-75-suez-canal-closure-lessons-trade>

# OPEC pressure
What role did the starting tensions with OPEC countries play? There where already tensions before the big 1973 (Yom Kipur War) embargo event. Thinking: Same as above, as hightened input price for agricultural production. Addionally: Higher revenues for oil exporting countries enabled them to buy more foods on global markets.
